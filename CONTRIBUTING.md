## 🏗️ Development Workflow

### Git Workflow

We use a simplified Git workflow:

1. **main** branch: Stable, production-ready code
2. **develop** branch: Integration branch for features
3. **feature/** branches: Individual feature development
4. **hotfix/** branches: Critical bug fixes

### Release Process

1. Features merged to **develop**
2. Testing and validation on **develop**
3. Release candidate created
4. Final testing and documentation
5. Merge to **main** and tag release

### Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, backward compatible

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Test Categories
