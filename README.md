## üìñ Usage Guide

### Creating Your First Assessment

1. **Navigate to Assessments**: Click on "Assessments" in the sidebar
2. **Create New Assessment**: Click "New Assessment" button
3. **Configure Assessment**: 
   - Enter assessment name and description
   - Select target domain

### Understanding Assessment Results

#### Zero Trust Score
Your Zero Trust Score is calculated across six key dimensions:
- **Identity Verification** (25%): MFA coverage, password policies, privileged accounts
- **Device Compliance** (20%): Device security posture and compliance
- **Network Segmentation** (15%): Network architecture and micro-segmentation
- **Data Protection** (15%): Encryption, data governance, and protection controls
- **Application Security** (15%): Application security controls and zero trust integration
- **Monitoring & Analytics** (10%): Visibility, logging, and threat detection

#### Maturity Levels
- **Traditional (0-30%)**: Legacy perimeter-based security model
- **Initial (30-50%)**: Basic zero trust controls implemented
- **Intermediate (50-75%)**: Comprehensive zero trust implementation
- **Advanced (75-100%)**: Mature zero trust architecture with automation

#### Risk Assessment
Risks are categorized into four levels:
- **Critical (75-100)**: Immediate action required
- **High (50-75)**: High priority remediation
- **Medium (25-50)**: Moderate risk requiring attention
- **Low (0-25)**: Low risk, monitor and maintain

### PowerShell Scripts

ADZero Trust includes comprehensive PowerShell modules for automated assessment:

#### Core Modules
- **AD-InfoGatherer.ps1**: Collects comprehensive Active Directory information
- **Identity-Analyzer.ps1**: Analyzes user accounts, service accounts, and privileged access
- **Permission-Assessor.ps1**: Evaluates permissions, group memberships, and access rights
- **Security-Auditor.ps1**: Assesses security configurations and compliance

#### Running Manual Assessments
```powershell
# Import the ADZero Trust modules
Import-Module .\PowerShell\Modules\AD-InfoGatherer.ps1
Import-Module .\PowerShell\Modules\Identity-Analyzer.ps1

# Run comprehensive assessment
.\PowerShell\Scripts\Start-ADZeroTrustAssessment.ps1 -Domain "contoso.com" -OutputPath "C:\Assessments"
```

## üîß Configuration

### Backend Configuration

The backend can be configured through environment variables or the configuration file:

```python
# config.py
DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///adzero_trust.db"
SECRET_KEY = "your-secret-key-here"
POWERSHELL_TIMEOUT = 3600  # 1 hour
MAX_ASSESSMENT_SIZE = 100000  # Maximum number of objects to assess
```

### Frontend Configuration

Frontend configuration is handled through environment variables:

```bash
# .env
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=development
REACT_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
